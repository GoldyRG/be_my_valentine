# Be My Valentine (Vite + React)

A playful Valentine prompt with a shy “No” button, a final “Ridiculous No Test,” and a “Yes” flow that now shows a fun reaction image (no external APIs needed).

## Run it locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Highlights
- Floating hearts/emoji vibe with a colorful gradient background.
- “Yes” shows a celebratory reaction image and cupid fly-in animation.
- “No” button dodges until the last try, then asks a silly test before letting you decline.
